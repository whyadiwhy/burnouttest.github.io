It includes subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events. Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing. It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fatigue and problems in concentration. Anxiety is closely related to fear, which is a response to a real or perceived immediate threat; anxiety involves the expectation of future threat.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>People facing anxiety may withdraw from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past.Anxiety disorders differ from developmentally normative fear or anxiety by being excessive or persisting beyond developmentally appropriate periods. They differ from transient fear or anxiety, often stress-induced, by being persistent (e.g., typically lasting 6 months or more), although the criterion for duration is intended as a general guide with allowance for some degree of flexibility and is sometimes of shorter duration in children.<\/p>\n<p><span><img alt=\"\" data-id=\"143\" width=\"559\" data-init-width=\"1000\" height=\"373\" data-init-height=\"667\" title=\"Sad woman looking rain through a window\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/resources.c50hope.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/depr.jpg\" data-width=\"559\" data-height=\"373\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Woman with anxiety looking at the rain through a window at home or hotel<\/p>\n<h5>Take this mental health test.
